# React Native: Unexpected Behavior from Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in React Native involving unexpected behavior stemming from a third-party library. The error message is vague, making debugging difficult. The issue is likely related to native modules or asynchronous operations.

## Problem

The app exhibits unexpected behavior without a clear error message pointing to the root cause. This is a classic case of debugging an unclear error caused by interactions between the main app code and a third-party library. 

## Solution

The proposed solution might involve several strategies: 

1. **Library Update:** Check for updates to the problematic third-party library and ensure that it's fully compatible with the current version of React Native.
2. **Dependency Conflicts:** Examine `package.json` for version conflicts between libraries. Utilize a tool like `npm-check-updates` or similar to assist.
3. **Asynchronous Debugging:** Carefully review asynchronous code that interacts with the third-party library using debugging tools (e.g. debugger statements, console.logs, remote debugging with React Native Debugger).
4. **Native Module Compatibility:** If the library utilizes native modules, verify their compatibility with the specific Android and iOS versions your app targets.
5. **Minimal Reproducible Example:** Create a small, isolated app that recreates the problem to help pinpoint the issue, simplifying the debugging process.
6. **Community Support:** Seek help in React Native communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, React Native subreddit).  Providing a minimal reproducible example is very important in this step.
